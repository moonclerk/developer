### Form

## Custom Fields

Fields contain the responses from the custom fields created on your
forms. They are accessed through either `payment.custom_fields` or `plan.custom_fields`.

The `custom_fields` variable is a Hash. [See how to loop over a Hash in Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers#for-loops).

The key will be the key you assign during the creation of your custom field in the payment form builder. The value contain the following fields:

- `title` - the title of the field
- `response` - the text response or the address on a single line
- `address` - contains field with the address parts. If the field is not an address it will be empty (null).

If address is not empty, it will contain:

- `address.line1`
- `address.line2`
- `address.city`
- `address.state`
- `address.postal_code`
- `address.county`

Here is a sample of the structure of some custom field data:

```
  'shipping_address' => {
    'title' => 'Shipping Address',
    'address' => {
      'line1' => '123 Sycamore St.',
      'line2' => 'Suite 100',
      'city' => 'Greenville',
      'state' => 'SC',
      'postal_code' => '29601',
      'country' => 'United States'
    },
    'response' => '123 Sycamore St., Suite 100, Greenville, SC 29601, United States'
  },
  'tshirt_size' => {
    'title' => 'T-shirt size',
    'address' => nil,
    'response' => 'X-Large'
  }
```
